<p>Just wanted to quickly mention that I have a blog post up on PwC’s Emerging Tech<br>blog on virtual reality across industries.  It was really exciting to be on a project<br>that used an interesting way to deliver VR.  There are so many possibilities to<br>this new medium and this article just scratches the surface.</p>

<p>We had a project come up at work that happened to be in React Native.  One of the<br>requested features for the app was having a way for users to login with their<br>Linkedin accounts. Since the project was deploying to both iOS and Android it had<br>to be built for both. I didn’t really see anything worthwhile out there currently<br>so I created my own and published it out on Github. You can check it out at<br><a href="https://www.github.com/jodybrewster/react-native-linkedin-login" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.github.com/jodybrewster/react-native-linkedin-login</a>.<br>I’ll have to create a writeup of my experience with React Native projects here at<br>some point so look for that soon.</p>
<p>Pull requests are welcome! Enjoy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/react-native-on-the-apple-tv/appletv.jpg" alt="Apple TV"></p>
<p>So I’ve had a chance to play around with React Native for a while (I have another app<br>in the oven) and I have some thoughts on that but more importantly it looks sweet<br>on the Apple TV!</p>
<p>For those of you not familiar with React Native, React Native is an open source<br>framework developed by Facebook to control native applications through javascript.<br>Which is much like phonegap/cordova except there’s no web view layer, just a bridge<br>for javascript to communicate back to ObjC/Swift or in Android’s case Java.  So I<br>can write javascript code for Apple TV for instance, then port it easily to the Nexus TV<br>on Android or maybe even a web experience through Firefox. In short its an<br>incredibly awesome technology.</p>
<p>And given my background with mobile apps and TVs specifically (our startup Gui.de<br>built TV apps).  I feel its my mission in life to get an app on the Apple TV (especially<br>since it was a no show at the time of our startup). Some things I’ve noticed<br>right off the bat are….</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There’s no UIFocusEnvironment which is obvious.  Its a new iOS 9 feature more<br>specific to Apple TV.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For some reason video doesn’t want its perspective to transform.  I still want<br>to experiment with this but for now it just locks up.  That would have looked soooo<br>rock n’ roll.</p>
</li>
<li><p>React Native is cooler than I thought.  Not like it wasn’t cool as hell to<br>begin with.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I uploaded a quick video of what I got running so far…</p>

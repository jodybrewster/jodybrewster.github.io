We had a project come up at work that happened to be in React Native.  One of the
requested features for the app was having a way for users to login with their
Linkedin accounts. Since the project was deploying to both iOS and Android it had
to be built for both. I didn't really see anything worthwhile out there currently
so I created my own and published it out on Github. You can check it out at
[https://www.github.com/jodybrewster/react-native-linkedin-login](https://www.github.com/jodybrewster/react-native-linkedin-login).
I'll have to create a writeup of my experience with React Native projects here at
some point so look for that soon.

Pull requests are welcome! Enjoy!
